      <description>There is this body that we inherited from evolution and there is us which is still an unknown entity. The fact here is that this physical body can be studied and discovered to see what we should do with it, how it works, how we might hurt it, and so on. There is some topic which we will discuss further how the functionality of it works and how we might have hurt it by our new and modern kind of living, the type of living which evolution didn&amp;rsquo;t make us for.</description>
